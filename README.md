# mechashy

mechashy has an automated deploy. Any changes to this repo will be deployed into multiple slacks. 

mechashy is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

I use this codebase to manage a few different hubots. If you add a feature to this hubot it'll be replicated accross a few private slacks with an automated deploy. Feel free to change things. I'll just revert if stuff breaks.
